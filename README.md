## SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
This is the repository for my applied data science capstone project from IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

## Project Background and Overview
The age of commercial space travel is no longer a far distant dream for humanity, instead, companies are now making space travel affordable for everyone. Companies such as Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin are at the forefront of these suborbital spaceflight developments. One company that has had exceptional success is SpaceX. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches for 62 million USD while other companies charge upwards of 165 million USD per launch. These savings are largely due to SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage; the first stage is the first rocket engine to engage, providing the initial thrust to send the rocket skyward, this stage is typically bigger than the next stage(s) because it must transport not only itself but the rest of the stages.

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. Provided that we can determine whether the first stage will land, we can also calculate the cost of a launch.
