# IBM Data Science Capstone Project
## SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
This is the repository for my applied data science capstone project from IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

## Project Background and Overview
The age of commercial space travel is no longer a far distant dream for humanity, instead, companies are now making space travel affordable for everyone. Companies such as Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin are at the forefront of these suborbital spaceflight developments. One company that has had exceptional success is SpaceX. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches for 62 million USD while other companies charge upwards of 165 million USD per launch. These savings are largely due to SpaceX’s ability to reuse the first stage; the first stage is the first rocket engine to engage, providing the initial thrust to send the rocket skyward, this stage is typically bigger than the next stage(s) because it must transport not only itself but the rest of the stages.

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. Provided that we can determine whether the first stage will land, we can also calculate the cost of a launch. 

## Summary of Results
* Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (CCAFS SLC 40 had the most launches
* Most launches were geosynchronous orbit (GTO)
* Success of first stage launches across all launch sites was 66.67%
* When payload is over 10,000 kg's almost all the first stage landings are successful
* ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO Orbits had the highest success rates
* The Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A was shown to have the highest success ratio for landing outcomes
* ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO Orbits had the highest success rates
* Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and KNN all predicted success of first launch with 83% accuracy
  
## Conclusions
The purpose of this project was to examine the relationship between several rocket launch features and how they potentially impact the landing outcome of Falcon 9 first stage. Using various ML model’s, we were able to determine the landing outcome with 83% accuracy.

The results from this project can help those who are interested in increasing their chances of producing landing outcomes with the best success.Finally, by determining whether the first stage will land successfully, findings from this project will help relevant stakeholders and companies to compete with SpaceX.
